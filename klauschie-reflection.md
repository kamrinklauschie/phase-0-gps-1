What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Memorizing all the different commands and which one happens next. How to create and merge a branch. 
Beyond Git, I've been existentially struggling with why we're doing any of this and why it is so damn specific. I wonder bigger questions like where does Netflix live when its live, and this course isn't helping me understand how the web works together. I feel like I'm in the weeds and don't have a high level view of how or why all these things play together. It would be nice to have a bird's eye view of why all of these little things matter and what they're building up to generally. It'd also be nice to have a sense of what things developers do in their day to day jobs, versus things I'm learning to conceptualize as a student rather than things I'll actually need to memorize and do regularly. It's hard to prioritize without this kind of high level context. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
- the difference between push and pull, how to conceptualize and memorize it 
- how to create and merge a branch 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked her about different Git commands and the specific definitions of almost everything and how it differentiated from something else. 

What still confuses you about Git?
I don't understand why there are so many commands to make a commit. It seems like a lot of overhead and its not very visual. Right now, what still confuses me is why its not more visual and why there are so many steps. I understand the concepts though. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I loved this so much. It is infinitely easier to pair and work together when learning these concepts. Until I figured out office hours, I didn't know how to do anything. GPS makes me feel like I'm not drowning in the ocean alone.
